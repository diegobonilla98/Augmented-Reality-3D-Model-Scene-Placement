# Augmented-Reality-3D-Model-Scene-Placement
A PokemonGO look-a-like marker based Augmented Reality demo.


Using keypoint descriptors algorithm (AKAZE) the homography matrix with defines the movement of the camera is calculated.
As the movement is calculated for each frame, the location of the model is global, so in case you turn the camera away from the model by the time you look back, the model will still being there for you. Doesn't that feel nice...

## Some GIFs to clear the mind:

Too big. Here is the Linkedln ![link] () to the videos.



## Warning!
This is some scripts I've made for tests and/or meaningless projects. They are not made to be easy to understand, optimized nor working. They surely have some interesting stuff so for any questions please talk to me in [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-bonilla-salvador/).
